# Django Assignment: Placement Statistics API

This Django project provides a RESTful API to fetch placement statistics for students. The API exposes a GET endpoint at `/api/v1/statistics/` that returns statistical insights such as highest CTC, lowest CTC, average CTC, median CTC, percentage of students placed, and a list of students with their placement details.

Create a virtual environment for better dependency management:

```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate    # On Windows use: venv\Scripts\activate
#if execution policy is set to restricted make it unrestricted if you find errors to activate virtual environment
Set-Execution-Policy Unrestricted -scope process
```
